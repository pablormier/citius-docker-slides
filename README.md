# Short introduction to Docker.

A very very short introduction to [docker](http://www.docker.com) for the 2nd edition of "Software development: Level Up!"
presented at CiTIUS.

Many resources have been taken from [dotCloud presentation at OSCON 2013](http://es.slideshare.net/dotCloud/why-docker2bisv4).
[Docker tutorial](https://docker.com/tryit) has also been adapted to be embedded in the presentation.
